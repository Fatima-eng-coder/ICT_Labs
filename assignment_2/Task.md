# Task 1
## Description
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a Public Cloud Platform and is currently the market leader based on various surveys conducted recently. It offers around 200 products and services. In this assignment, you are going to get the flavor of using Cloud Computing Platform and its Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model. Specifically, you are required to build and deploy your html-based CV page over the Public Cloud, AWS. 
You are going to deploy the CV page using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), an IaaS based service offering the broadest and deepest compute platform. Roughly, following steps would be needed for the deployment:
- Create an Ubuntu based virtual machine, an EC2 instance
- Add security rules to EC2 instance allowing various access (e.g., SSH, HTTP etc.)
- Generate keys pair and use an SSH client to access the EC2 instance.
- Use package manager to install the web server 
- Setup the web server to display your CV web page
## Outcomes
Upon completion of this assignment, you will have better understanding of the:
- AWS Cloud Computing Platform 
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model in the cloud
- EC2 instance and how to install web server there
- Deployment of a simple web page over EC2 instance
## Deliverable
Itâ€™s an individual assignment and you need to submit a well formatted report documenting all the micro steps along with the screenshots and listing the URL that can be used to access your deployed CV page. The report should serve as a manual for someone who wants to deploy a web page using EC2 instance.
